# blender-spacing-tool
The Blender Spacing Tool (BST v1.0) is a FREE plugin for Blender that allows the user to space an array of instantiated objects along a curve or path. This plugin has been designed to improve the process of arraying an object along a curve, and has been inspired by a similar feature present in 3DsMax.
